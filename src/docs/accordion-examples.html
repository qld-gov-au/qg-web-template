                      <p>Sexual violence is any unwanted sexual behaviour or act that is forced on you or your body when you haven&rsquo;t agreed to it or you&rsquo;ve felt pressured to do it. In some instances it may have occurred when you were too young to understand what was happening.</p><p>Sexual violence can happen to anyone, regardless of their age, gender, sexuality, cultural background or mental/physical abilities. Sexual violence can include things like:</p><ul type="disc"><li>unwanted touching or kissing</li><li>being pressured or forced to do sexual things</li><li>being pressured or forced to do sexual things to someone else's body.</li></ul><p>Sexual violence also includes actions that do not involve touching, such as being:</p><ul type="disc"><li>photographed without some of your clothes on</li><li>told sexual things which make you feel uncomfortable</li><li>shown images or videos of a sexual nature in magazines or movies, or on a mobile phone or computer</li><li>pressured into sexual activities online</li><li>sent emails, voice or text messages of a sexual nature, like unwanted sexting.</li></ul><p>If any of these things have happened&ndash;or are happening&ndash;to you, it is <strong>not </strong>okay. The most important thing to know is that your body is yours, and you make the decisions about what you do with it and who you do it with.</p>
